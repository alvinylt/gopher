This Internet Gopher client implementation in the C language references [RFC
1436](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1436).

To test the server, a local Gopher server can be started using
[Motsognir](https://github.com/unisx/motsognir) with the command
`sudo motsognir`. The listening port and the process can be listed using the
command `sudo lsof -i :70`.
